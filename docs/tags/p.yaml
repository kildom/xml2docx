- tag-name: p
  brief: Paragraph.
  children: [ font ]
  implicit: font
  details: |
    This tag is used to create a paragraph.

    You can use attributes passing to change text style of this paragraph since direct children are `<font>` tags,
    for example:
    ```
    <p font.color="red">Warning!</p>
    ```
    This is shorter version of the following:
    ```
    <p><font color="red">Warning!</font></p>
    ```

    For multiple paragraphs that shares the same style, you should use the `style=""` attribute and `<p-style>` tag.
